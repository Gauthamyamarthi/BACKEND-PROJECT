# BACKEND-PROJECT
A full-stack Node.js web application that mimics basic Quora functionality using Express.js and EJS templating. Users can create, view, edit, and delete posts dynamically. The project uses in-memory data storage and serves static assets with Express middleware. Ideal for learning CRUD operations, routing, and server-side rendering with EJS.
